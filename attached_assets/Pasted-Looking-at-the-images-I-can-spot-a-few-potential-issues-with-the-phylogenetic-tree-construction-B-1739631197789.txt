Looking at the images, I can spot a few potential issues with the phylogenetic tree construction:

Branch Length Issues:


The branches appear to be of arbitrary length rather than reflecting true evolutionary distances
Some branches are extremely long while others are bunched together
Early splits (like between major groups) should generally be deeper in the tree


Topology Problems:


In Image 2, I can see Codium (an algae), Picea (a conifer), and Selaginella (a lycophyte) - these should be showing much more distinct evolutionary separations
The branching pattern doesn't seem to reflect true evolutionary relationships
There appears to be some collapsed nodes that should be showing hierarchical structure

Here's what we should modify:
pythonCopydef build_taxonomy_hierarchy(df: pd.DataFrame) -> Dict:
    # Add proper evolutionary distances
    rank_distances = {
        "kingdom": 4.0,
        "phylum": 3.0,
        "class": 2.5,
        "order": 2.0,
        "family": 1.5,
        "genus": 1.0,
        "species": 0.5
    }
    
    # Sort observations by taxonomy to ensure proper grouping
    sorted_df = df.sort_values(by=["kingdom", "phylum", "class", "order", "family", "genus", "species"])
    
    # Track last common ancestor for better branch placement
    last_common_ancestor = {}
    
    # Build hierarchy with proper evolutionary relationships
    hierarchy = {}
    for _, row in sorted_df.iterrows():
        current_level = hierarchy
        current_distance = 0
        for rank in ["kingdom", "phylum", "class", "order", "family", "genus", "species"]:
            if pd.isna(row[rank]):
                break
                
            taxon_id = row[rank]
            current_distance += rank_distances[rank]
            
            if taxon_id not in current_level:
                current_level[taxon_id] = {
                    "name": row["name"] if rank == "species" else "",
                    "common_name": row["common_name"] if rank == "species" else "",
                    "rank": rank,
                    "distance": current_distance,  # Add evolutionary distance
                    "children": {}
                }
                
                # Update last common ancestor
                last_common_ancestor[rank] = taxon_id
                
            current_level = current_level[taxon_id]["children"]
And in the visualization component:
javascriptCopy// Adjust branch lengths based on evolutionary distance
const getBranchPath = (source, target) => {
  const deltaX = target.x - source.x;
  const deltaY = target.y - source.y;
  
  // Scale branch length by evolutionary distance
  const length = target.data.distance - source.data.distance;
  
  return `M ${source.x} ${source.y}
          C ${source.x + deltaX/3} ${source.y},
            ${source.x + 2*deltaX/3} ${target.y},
            ${target.x} ${target.y}`;
};

// Adjust node spacing based on taxonomic rank
const getNodeSpacing = (node) => {
  const rankSpacing = {
    kingdom: 200,
    phylum: 150,
    class: 120,
    order: 100,
    family: 80,
    genus: 60,
    species: 40
  };
  return rankSpacing[node.data.rank] || 40;
};
This should help create a more accurate phylogenetic tree by:

Using proper evolutionary distances for branch lengths
Maintaining correct hierarchical relationships
Spacing nodes according to taxonomic rank
Ensuring major evolutionary splits are properly represented
