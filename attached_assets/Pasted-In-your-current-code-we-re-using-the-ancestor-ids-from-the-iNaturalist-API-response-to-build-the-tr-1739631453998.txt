In your current code, we're using the ancestor_ids from the iNaturalist API response to build the tree structure - basically a list of IDs representing the taxonomic lineage of each observation. Let me look at what other taxonomic data iNaturalist provides that we might be able to use:

From a standard observation response:

pythonCopy{
    "taxon": {
        "ancestor_ids": [1, 2, 3...],  # What we're currently using
        "ancestors": [  # Full ancestor objects we could use instead
            {
                "id": 1,
                "name": "Animalia",
                "rank": "kingdom",
                "rank_level": 70
            },
            # ... more ancestors
        ],
        "rank_level": 10,  # Numerical rank (could help with proper tree levels)
        "iconic_taxon_id": 1,  # High-level grouping (e.g., "Plants", "Insects")
        "iconic_taxon_name": "Animalia",
        "parent_id": 123,  # Direct parent taxon
        "name": "Species name",
        "rank": "species"
    }
}
Ah! We're not using some valuable data here - particularly:

The full ancestors array which includes names and ranks
The rank_level which could help with proper tree depth
iconic_taxon_id which could help with major branch organization

We could modify the data processing to use this richer information:
pythonCopydef process_observations(observations: List[Dict]) -> pd.DataFrame:
    processed_data = []
    
    for obs in observations:
        if not obs.get("taxon") or not obs.get("id"):
            continue
            
        taxon = obs["taxon"]
        ancestors = taxon.get("ancestors", [])
        
        # Create a more complete taxonomic record
        taxon_data = {
            "observation_id": obs["id"],
            "taxon_id": taxon["id"],
            "name": taxon["name"],
            "rank": taxon["rank"],
            "rank_level": taxon["rank_level"],
            "iconic_taxon_id": taxon.get("iconic_taxon_id"),
            "iconic_taxon_name": taxon.get("iconic_taxon_name"),
        }
        
        # Add ancestor data with proper ranks
        for ancestor in ancestors:
            rank = ancestor["rank"]
            taxon_data[rank] = ancestor["id"]
            taxon_data[f"{rank}_name"] = ancestor["name"]
            taxon_data[f"{rank}_level"] = ancestor["rank_level"]
            
        processed_data.append(taxon_data)
This richer data could help build a more accurate tree because:

We'd have actual rank levels rather than assuming depth
We'd have the proper taxonomic names at each level
We could use iconic taxa for major branch organization
The rank_level values could inform proper branch lengths
