Yes, we need to calculate node positions from the bottom up (species level) to properly space everything without overlapping lines. Each higher taxonomic level should be positioned based on the average position of its children, with enough vertical spacing between sibling groups.
Here's how we could modify our approach:
pythonCopydef calculate_tree_layout(hierarchy: Dict) -> Dict:
    """Calculate node positions bottom-up to avoid line intersections"""
    
    def get_leaf_count(node):
        """Get count of leaf nodes (species) under this node"""
        if not node["children"]:
            return 1
        return sum(get_leaf_count(child) for child in node["children"].values())
    
    def calculate_positions(node, x_pos=0, y_start=0, vertical_spacing=50):
        """Calculate x,y positions for each node and its children"""
        # Get number of leaves under this node to calculate spacing
        leaf_count = get_leaf_count(node)
        
        if not node["children"]:
            # Leaf node (species)
            node["x"] = x_pos
            node["y"] = y_start
            return y_start + vertical_spacing
        
        # Calculate children positions
        current_y = y_start
        child_x = x_pos + 120  # Horizontal spacing between levels
        
        # Position each child and get their y-coordinates
        child_y_positions = []
        for child in node["children"].values():
            next_y = calculate_positions(child, child_x, current_y, vertical_spacing)
            child_y_positions.append(child["y"])
            current_y = next_y
        
        # Position this node at average of children's y-coordinates
        node["x"] = x_pos
        node["y"] = sum(child_y_positions) / len(child_y_positions)
        
        return current_y
    
    # Start positioning from root
    calculate_positions(hierarchy)
    return hierarchy
And modify the visualization component to use these calculated positions:
javascriptCopyconst TreeVisualizer = ({ data }) => {
  // Draw branches using calculated positions
  const renderBranches = (node) => {
    if (!node.children) return null;
    
    return Object.values(node.children).map(child => (
      <g key={`branch-${child.name}`}>
        <path
          d={`M ${node.x} ${node.y} 
              C ${(node.x + child.x) / 2} ${node.y},
                ${(node.x + child.x) / 2} ${child.y},
                ${child.x} ${child.y}`}
          fill="none"
          stroke="#666"
          strokeWidth="1"
        />
        {renderBranches(child)}
      </g>
    ));
  };

  // Draw nodes using calculated positions
  const renderNodes = (node) => {
    return (
      <g key={`node-${node.name}`}>
        <circle
          cx={node.x}
          cy={node.y}
          r="4"
          fill="#000"
        />
        <text
          x={node.x + 10}
          y={node.y}
          dy=".3em"
        >
          {node.name}
        </text>
        {node.children && Object.values(node.children).map(child => renderNodes(child))}
      </g>
    );
  };

  return (
    <svg width="1200" height="800">
      <g transform="translate(50, 400)">
        {renderBranches(data)}
        {renderNodes(data)}
      </g>
    </svg>
  );
};
Key improvements:

Calculates position from bottom (species) up
Uses leaf count to determine proper vertical spacing
Positions parent nodes at the average y-coordinate of their children
Maintains consistent horizontal spacing between taxonomic levels
Ensures no branch intersections by reserving appropriate vertical space
