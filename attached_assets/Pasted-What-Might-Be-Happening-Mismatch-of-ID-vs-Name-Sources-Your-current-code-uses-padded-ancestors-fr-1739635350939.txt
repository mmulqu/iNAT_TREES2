What Might Be Happening
Mismatch of ID vs. Name Sources:
Your current code uses padded_ancestors (from taxon["ancestor_ids"]) to fill columns like "kingdom", "phylum", etc. In many iNaturalist API responses, these ancestor IDs may not always be provided (or may not be in the expected order). At the same time, you’re setting the hover text using fields like "taxon_kingdom", which are populated by either taxon.get("kingdom_name") or by looking up the "ancestors" list.

Inconsistent Data:
It’s possible that the API response does include an "ancestors" list (with proper "id" and "name" fields) but the "ancestor_ids" field is missing or not aligned with the "ancestors" list. In that case, your DataFrame ends up with empty or misaligned values for the higher taxon IDs (the ones used to build the hierarchy) even though you might have the names.

How to Fix It
A robust solution is to build your DataFrame columns for the ancestor IDs and names directly from the "ancestors" array rather than relying on "ancestor_ids" and the padded list. For each rank (e.g. "kingdom", "phylum", etc.) you can do the following:

Extract the ID and name from the ancestors list by filtering for the matching rank.
Assign these to separate columns so that later in build_taxonomy_hierarchy you have a consistent key (the taxon ID) and a consistent name (the taxon name).
Below is a revised version of the process_observations method that does this:

Explanation
Extracting Ancestor Information Directly:
Instead of using padded_ancestors from ancestor_ids, we loop through the "ancestors" list (which is typically provided by the API) to extract both the ID and name for each rank.
We add two sets of columns:
"{rank}_id": the numeric ID from the ancestor.
"taxon_{rank}": the name for that rank.
Species Data:
For species, we directly use the taxon’s "id" and "name".
Building the Hierarchy:
In build_taxonomy_hierarchy, we now look for the ancestor IDs from our new columns (e.g. "kingdom_id"). The hover text is taken from the corresponding "taxon_{rank}" column. This ensures that when you hover over a node (say a phylum), its name (like "Arthropoda") appears as expected.
